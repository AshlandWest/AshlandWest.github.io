              <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
              <p class="skillContent" style="display:none">
                Creative problem solving has always been a passion of mine and is one of my primary interests in software development.
                <br />
                Challenges are made to be overcome, puzzles are made to be solved, and tedious tasks are made to be automated!

              <h3>Community Leadership</h3>
              <p class="skillContent" style="display:none">
                I have years of experience in professional community leadership as an organizer of North Bay Fusion, a dance venue in Sebastopol, California.
                <br />
                Informally, my leadership experience goes back to Highschool, as president of the Writer's Club. Collage, as President of the Social Dance club and I.C.C. Representative of our competitive Hip-Hop dance team.
                <br />
                In my personal life, I find or create community wherever I go, from creating study-groups, to organizing events and activities, I believe interpersonal connections are at the heart of any healthy environment.

              <h3>Instruction and Mentorship</h3>
              <p class="skillContent" style="display:none">
                I have many years of experience teaching, starting from childhood, helping mentor less experienced martial arts students.
                <br />
                In high school, I began teaching dance and parkour on an amateur level. After graduation, I coached my old wrestling team and eventually began teaching dance professionally. I teach locally, statewide, and now internationally as well.

              <h3>Project Management</h3>
              <p class="skillContent" style="display:none">
                In 2016, I was placed at the head of PBHS's Silent Partner product, answering directly to the corporation's vice-president. In that time, I grew what was a failing product, months overdue for delivery, and no working prototype, to a multi-million dollar asset endorsed by the American Dental Association and found in dental offices around the world.

              <h3>Professional Integrity</h3>
              <p class="skillContent" style="display:none">
                I believe every task a person completes is a reflection of their character. I take pride in my work as an extension of my own integrity and pride in myself as an engineer.
                <br />
                I am a firm believer in the "Find time to do it right or find time to do it twice" mentality and thus am committed to pushing my best work every time. 
                <br />
                I believe the user experience should influence development, not the other way around. This means the end-user of a product should not have to change their behavior or struggle with unintuitive interfaces just because it was easier to write that way. I am an engineer. Solving big problems is what I do, and "just okay" is never good enough.
              </p>

              <h3>Technical and Layman's Communication</h3>
              <p class="skillContent" style="display:none">
                My years of professional help-desk experience have fostered an acute talent at explaining highly technical concepts in simple layman's terms. This ranges from simply discussing the hows and whys of a subject to training 80-year-old customers to edit their own websites.
                <br />
                In addition the this, I am experienced in the high-level communication required to effectively and efficiently express ideas to other developers, making me a valuable asset in presenting ideas interdepartmentally and helping clarify things for new engineers or bring them up to speed on current projects.
